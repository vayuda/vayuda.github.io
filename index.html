                                        As a computer science master's student
                                        at UCSD, I spend a lot of time thinking
                                        about how we explore and discover new
                                        things, both in research and in life.
                                        This website is an extension of that
                                        exploration, a place where I share all
                                        the cool things I've worked on and talk
                                        about what interests me.

                                <p>
                                    My friend Nikhil and I uncovered something
                                    unexpected: OpenAI's Deep Research feature
                                    (which I will refer to as ODR) can be used
                                    to hunt down exposed API keys in public
                                    GitHub and HuggingFace repositories.
                                    Ironically this includes the very keys
                                    needed to access OpenAI's own services. This
                                    feature was recently made available to
                                    $20/month Plus subscribers, putting a
                                    powerful web search tool in many more hands.
                                    The key concern to us...

                                <p>
                                    I found myself in the produce aisle at my
                                    local grocery store, perplexed by the
                                    dizzying array of apples in front of me.
                                    Gala, Honeycrisp, Granny Smith, and many
                                    others I've never even heard of. I'd love to
                                    know what a "Snap Dragon" apple tastes like,
                                    but the descriptions make it seem like just
                                    about every apple is somewhat sweet,
                                    somewhat tangy, and somewhat crisp. I
                                    couldn't ponder much longer because I still
                                    had ten other items to buy...

                            My friend Nikhil and I uncovered something
                            unexpected: OpenAI's Deep Research feature (which I
                            will refer to as ODR) can be used to hunt down
                            exposed API keys in public GitHub and HuggingFace
                            repositories. Ironically this includes the very keys
                            needed to access OpenAI's own services. This feature
                            was recently made available to $20/month Plus
                            subscribers, putting a powerful web search tool in
                            many more hands. The key concern to us (no pun
                            intended) was that we did not employ any
                            sophisticated jailbreaking technique to achieve this
                            outcome: anyone could have done this too.

                            What is Deep Research?
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            This term has begun to refer to a broad group of LLM
                            tools augmented with web search capabilities. ODR
                            specifically empowers ChatGPT to automatically
                            search the web to analyze and parse content from a
                            broad number of sources and provide a comprehensive
                            summary to user queries. For example, you can ask it
                            to search the market for a particular bicycle that
                            matches your height, budget, and features you really
                            need. It will then access dozens of websites, parse
                            the listings, and synthesize a list for you in about
                            five minutes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Traditional chat usage has been to ask a question
                            and get an answer instantly, but now we are seeing
                            an evolution in how LLM's are being used as a part
                            of larger systems capable of doing longer horizon
                            tasks. In fact, OpenAI wasn't the first to release
                            this kind of tool. Google released a product with
                            the same name late last year, Grok just added this
                            feature as well, and Perplexity's whole business is
                            integrating LLM's with web search. While these tools
                            represent the cutting edge of AI assistance, they
                            can also create unexpected security implications -
                            as we discovered recently.

                            Our Serendipitous Discovery
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            While working on a project for an LLM security
                            class, my partner Nikhil and I were using Gemini's
                            free fine-tuning service, which made me wonder
                            whether OpenAI had similar free offerings. To my
                            dismay, I found that they had discontinued their API
                            sign up promotion for free api credits long ago.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This made me recollect the time when ChatGPT was
                            first released, how it produced a flock of
                            unseasoned developers who knew nothing about
                            security and ended up exposing their API keys
                            online. Mostly as a joke, and partly wishful
                            thinking, I wondered whether ChatGPT's new web
                            search feature could be used to find these secrets.
                            Here is what I tried below:
                        </p>
                        <figure style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0">

                                style="max-width: 100%"
                            />
                            <figcaption
                                style="
                                    font-style: italic;
                                    color: var(--coffee);
                                    margin-top: 10px;
                                "
                            >
                                Looks like the search feature isn't able to
                                scrape arbitrary websites.
                            </figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <p>
                            While I thought I ended up empty handed, Nikhil
                            noticed that it didn't refuse the request. Having a
                            plus membership, he tried the prompt with ODR along
                            with a few clarifying follow up statements. The end
                            result is shown below:
                        </p>
                        <figure style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0">

                                    margin-top: 10px;
                                "
                            >
                                ODR was successfully able to scrape enough
                                repositories to find keys.
                            </figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <p>
                            The first deep search gave about a dozen or so keys,
                            of which one actually worked (we responsibly
                            notified the owner of the repository after
                            confirming the key was active). A naive second
                            attempt did not yield any new active keys, but with
                            limited queries per month, we didn't get to
                            substantially test this.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This initial success raised an important question:
                            was this capability unique to OpenAI's
                            implementation, or could other similar tools be used
                            in the same way? Both Perplexity and Grok have
                            similar features available for free. I tried the
                            exact same prompt and some variations, but
                            ultimately none were successful because they said
                            they werent really capable of parsing through
                            websites like a human would. It seems they just have
                            access to some limited search API.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This highlights a key difference between Perplexity
                            and ODR. Perplexity simply utilizes its pre-training
                            data and any relevant data that comes from simple
                            searches. On the other hand, ODR is capable of
                            performing real time analysis by running python
                            code. This is evident when looking at the provided
                            reasoning trace:
                        </p>

                                It seems to be going through a loop of thinking
                                about what to search next, retrieving that
                                information, and then analyzing it in Python.
                                This last step is where the magic probably
                                happens.

                            While we can't know exactly how Deep Research works
                            internally, our observations suggest it might differ
                            in these ways:
                        </p>

                                It appears to leverage web scraping rather than
                                direct API access
                            </li>

                                It seems to reason about where its most likely
                                to find keys (like .env files)
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                It seems capable of implementing rudimentary
                                scripts to perform pattern recognition while
                                also using context from surrounding code
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            What's most significant is not necessarily advanced
                            technical capabilities, but rather the
                            accessibility. ODR packages existing scanning
                            techniques into a user-friendly interface that
                            requires no technical setup or specialized
                            knowledge. This democratization of security tooling
                            is the real change, as it puts previously
                            specialized techniques into anyone's hands through a
                            simple chat interface.

                            In our limited testing, we can't conclusively state
                            that it's more effective than traditional tools, but
                            in a rapidly evolving landscape, many capabilities
                            may seem to emerge out of no where. Just remember
                            how most of the world was shocked at the launch of
                            ChatGPT in 2022 even though anyone who had been
                            paying attention could have seen it coming. For
                            better or worse, these tech giants control destiny.
                            If they make a shiny new tool, everyone will try to
                            recreate it, including open source versions. This
                            provides more and more opportunities for adversaries
                            to find exploits.

                            that plagued Uber is now becoming easier to exploit,
                            highlighting how security considerations often

                            In hindsight, this seemingly intuitive yet malicious
                            use case of Deep Research likely went under the
                            product team's radar because they were focused on
                            intended applications rather than potential misuse.
                            This oversight demonstrates a recurring pattern in
                            AI development:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                A capability is released with legitimate use
                                cases in mind
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The same capability enables unexpected misuse
                                cases
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Only after public release do these misuse cases
                                become apparent
                            </li>

                            This is precisely why red teaming is crucial for AI
                            systems. Effective red teams approach products with
                            an adversarial mindset, asking not &quot;What was
                            this designed to do?&quot; but &quot;How could this
                            be misused?&quot; The challenge isn't just
                            identifying technical exploits like jailbreaks or
                            prompt injections, but also anticipating how normal
                            features might intersect with sensitive domains in
                            unexpected ways.&quot;
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As capabilities of these LLM agents increase, we
                            must be increasingly aware of these adversarial use
                            cases. Browser automation could be used for digital
                            dumpster diving: systematically search through
                            public data sources for specific types of
                            information (financial data, personal details,
                            internal documentation) that was accidentally made
                            public. They can also aid in illegal operations. For
                            example, these tools could potentially find and
                            utilize credentials to create networks of accounts
                            for crypto tumbling, wash trading, or market
                            manipulation. Its important to re-iterate that these
                            tools will only get stronger in the next few years.

                            bounty. Companies can also benefit from dedicated
                            adversarial use teams that specifically focus on how
                            features could be repurposed in unexpected ways.
                            They would also benefit from ensuring that employees
                            are aware of critical safety practices. After all,

                            The Paradox of Choice
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            I found myself in the produce aisle at my local
                            grocery store, perplexed by the dizzying array of
                            apples in front of me. Gala, Honeycrisp, Granny
                            Smith, and many others I've never even heard of. I'd
                            love to know what a "Snap Dragon" apple tastes like,
                            but the descriptions make it seem like just about
                            every apple is somewhat sweet, somewhat tangy, and
                            somewhat crisp. I couldn't ponder much longer
                            because I still had ten other items to buy.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Whether you're the head chef or running errands like
                            me, you may wonder which of these ever-increasing
                            varieties is the best choice. The abundance of
                            choice may lead to better dishes, but often leads to
                            more confusion. Understanding the properties of each
                            ingredient is therefore crucial to effective
                            cooking. The foundation of any great dish is the
                            careful thought and consideration that goes behind
                            the ingredients used in it.

                                flavors from China and Taiwan. In that case,
                                I’ll make a stronger claim: except for sushi,
                                every single dish in Japanese cuisine is done
                                better by another Asian cuisine: jiaozi over
                                gyoza, pakora over tempura, pho over ramen, mul
                                naengmyeon over soba, hot pot over shabu shabu,
                                Indian curries over Japanese, and Korean
                                barbecue over yakiniku (except wagyu). When I
                                workshopped this theory I heard a feeble defense
                                raising okonomiyaki. I did have to think, but
                                jianbing and bánh xèo still win. Unless you plan
                                on eating sushi every day (I would), choose
                                Taiwan.

                            This struck a chord because I've always felt that
                            Japanese food enjoys absurd levels of popularity
                            relative to other Asian cuisines. While he left out
                            some dishes such as udon (chewy noodles) and katsu
                            (breaded meat cutlets), I still agree with most of
                            his critique. However, the discussions I had with a
                            few friends revealed something I had overlooked:
                            simplicity can provide its own advantages.

                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            Japanese cuisine emphasizes maximizing the quality
                            and flavor from a select few ingredients at the
                            expense of variety. This could be explained
                            geographically: Japan is a mountainous archipelago
                            far removed from the equator where most of the land
                            is not suitable for agriculture which means there
                            really isn’t a lot of room for growing a diverse
                            array of vegetables or raising livestock. This can
                            lead to feelings monotony, and even one of my
                            friends who loves Japanese food had to take breaks
                            from it during his stay. This is one of the main
                            reasons why I was never excited about Japanese food,
                            but I also under-appreciated the benefits of this
                            restriction.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Japanese cuisine's characteristic focus on
                            ingredient quality means that even basic dishes are
                            delicious. Nowhere is this more evident than in
                            Japan's convenience stores, which have earned
                            international acclaim. Instead of dedicating
                            extensive time to seeking out high-end restaurants,
                            travelers can confidently grab meals to-go before
                            heading off to explore. Local citizens can also
                            appreciate this convenience because Japanese work
                            culture is known to be demanding, leaving people
                            with little energy to cook something when they get
                            back home.

                                Yep sashimi is just raw fish, and it's
                                surprisingly good???

                            This high baseline quality runs deeper than
                            convenience. By focusing on a few key ingredients,
                            Japanese chefs can achieve extraordinary mastery.
                            Critics and casual diners alike can appreciate the
                            requisite skill to create raw seafood dishes such as
                            sashimi. There's no need to explain about the
                            technicalities of a bain-marie to impress them.
                            Watching a chef assemble sushi in front of you adds
                            a unique visual and experiential appeal.

                            Another advantage of simplicity means its easy to
                            add things on top to increase the variety. Regional
                            trade networks have led to Japan's adaptation of
                            spicy elements from its Asian neighbors. Tantanmen,
                            which incorporates the same doubanjiang (chili bean
                            paste) found in Sichuan's mapo tofu, demonstrates
                            how Japanese cuisine can thoughtfully integrate
                            external influences while maintaining its
                            distinctive character. While traditional sushi
                            celebrates the pure flavor of fish, modern
                            interpretations incorporate various sauces that add
                            layers of complexity. Its much harder to do this
                            with a complex dish where there are already so many
                            different flavors competing for your attention.

                            As an aside, none of this would be possible unless
                            the society as a whole strived to make high quality
                            ingredients accessible to everyone. The same quality
                            $5 sushi in the convenience store would cost up to
                            $20 in the US, which helps explain my initial
                            skepticism about Japanese cuisine's reputation.
                            Unfortunately, this mark up reflects the broader
                            issue where a lack in quality is made up for using
                            additives like high fructose corn syrup. Fresh meat
                            and produce come at a steep price and it's sometimes
                            cheaper to eat mass produced processed food instead.
                            It's really no wonder why

                            While Japanese cuisine demonstrates how intentional
                            ingredient selection can elevate even simple dishes,
                            recent trends in other cuisines show what happens
                            when this principle is overlooked in favor of
                            appealing to social media.

                        <p>
                            There has been a recent trend of adding mozzarella
                            cheese to dishes like tteokbokki (rice cakes),
                            dakgalbi (spicy chicken), and even traditional
                            stews. While some combinations like cheese + buldak
                            (fire chicken) have become popular, others feel much
                            more forced. Restaurants face intense competition
                            and understandably, some end up pandering to the
                            trend in a short sighted attempt to stay relevant.

                            With thousands of cheese varieties available,
                            mozzarella is rarely the optimal choice. Yet, its

                            visited Korea recently describes his grievances: a
                            perfectly seasoned grilled chicken has absolutely no
                            need for such a bland accompaniment that doesn't
                            even stick properly to the chicken anyway. Leave the
                            cheese pulls for dishes like pizza.

                            dish, but because its presence allows the restaurant
                            to double the menu price and create an

                            Then there's wagyu, the mere mention of which brings
                            people to salivation. When my friend suggested Jeju
                            Noodle Bar, a Michelin-starred establishment serving
                            wagyu ramyun, I jumped at the chance. When the dish
                            finally arrived, I took a second to take it all in.
                            Here was a piping hot bowl of ramyun with thin
                            slices of wagyu draped neatly on the top. The broth
                            was undeniably delicious, but the wagyu...it was
                            almost lost. The fat, which I expected to melt on my
                            tongue like butter, simply dissolved into the broth,
                            leaving behind strips of meat that, while tender,
                            could have been any decent cut of beef. There was no
                            distinct wagyu flavor, almost as if the broth had
                            swallowed it whole. At $45 a bowl, I couldn't help
                            but feel a twinge of disappointment. In the future I
                            hope to try a dish that better showcases what makes
                            wagyu so special.

                            Soup Dumplings: a Premium that Justifies Itself
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            Not all premium-priced dishes reflect thoughtless
                            luxury additions. Though some would argue that
                            adding soup to dumplings is just another gimmick to
                            raise the price of the dish, xiao long bao
                            incorporates the ingredient much more honestly and
                            leads to a unique experience that justifies the
                            price bump.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Having attempted the creation of the dish myself,
                            incorporating the soup into the dumpling is no easy
                            feat. The flavor of the soup has to be infused into
                            a gelatinous binding and broken up to evenly mix
                            with the rest of the filling. Folding the dough
                            around this filling also takes great care to prevent
                            it from deforming while steaming. Doing it once will
                            humble you. Doing it fifty times will leave you with
                            immense respect to the chefs who churn these out at
                            restaurant scale.

                                It looks more like Shumai than a soup dumpling,
                                a testament to the skill required to make these.

                            Unlike the previous cases, the intention behind
                            adding soup inside a dumpling makes sense. The soups
                            liquid richness harmonizes well with the rest of the
                            filling as the meat becomes juicy and tender. If
                            anything, soup dumplings are the opposite of
                            gimmicks; they are a testament to culinary
                            technique. The careful construction required to
                            encase a flavorful broth within a delicate wrapper
                            is far from a simple trick. While other related
                            dishes such as baozi share some similarities in
                            their filling-to-wrapper ratio, none quite replicate
                            the experience of biting into a soup dumpling.

                        <p>
                            If you've made it this far, I hope you take some
                            time to reflect about various dishes you've tried
                            and how the ingredients played a role in your
                            enjoyment of it. As a home cook, I often enjoy
                            combining various ingredients all willy-nilly like
                            some mad scientist. This experience has shown me the
                            value of intentional ingredient selection, and I
                            plan to apply that more going forward.

                            As an aside, I was curious to see how Claude could
                            help me write this post without completely losing my
                            influence in it. My workflow was repeatedly writing
                            and asking for improvements. It definitely sped up
                            the time to achieve a certain level of quality I was
                            acceptable with as the biggest issue I had was tying
                            things together in a way that flowed naturally. I
                            also think it helps with writers block since it is
                            able to quickly generate more supporting examples or
                            further areas of exploration. With time, I'm sure I
                            could even feed it enough writing samples to where
                            it is able to write things in my style.

                            Finally, I plan to keep writing on various random
                            topics so stay tuned for more!
